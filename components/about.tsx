      My journey into technology began during my academic path, which was primarily focused on marketing. I discovered that CRM perfectly bridges the gap between Marketing and Technology, and it has become my favorite area to explore. I thrive on learning something new every day and enjoy challenging myselfâ€”whether it's solving complex problems or experimenting with new tools, such as those I used while developing this website. The satisfaction of untangling a tricky issue and finding its solution is truly rewarding.

      When itâ€™s time to relax, youâ€™ll find me playing video games, reading books, or hanging out with friends â€” though getting me out of the house can be a difficult task sometimes.
